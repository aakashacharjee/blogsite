        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        Hello, I'm Aakash Acharjee, a recent Master's in Computer Application graduate with a burning passion for all things software development. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, C, and C++. I'm always keen to explore new technologies, which is why I've delved into front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and even dabbled in the exciting world of React and Flutter.       
        </p>
        <p>
        My desire to understand the complete development picture doesn't stop at the front-end. I'm equally proficient in Node.js for back-end development and comfortable working with MySQL databases.  I believe the best way to learn is by doing, which led me to two fantastic internships. One involved building a travel agency website using WordPress, HTML, and CSS, and the other focused on creating engaging Android apps using Flutter.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm constantly seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge, expand my skillset, and contribute to a collaborative and innovative team environment. Whether it's crafting sleek user interfaces, designing efficient back-end logic, or exploring the latest development trends, I'm ready to dive in and make a meaningful impact.
        </p>
